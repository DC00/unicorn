CMS and front end app for student news publication

###Brief 
The Cavalier Daily, a student news publication at the University of Virginia, is undertaking this project to create a
new web presence and content management system for the paper. 

###Function
We hope that this repository will eventually become a backend Django app that will handle CRUD of articles, authors, and tags. 
Our front end will be built with AngularJS that will consume our content API mocked out with the Django REST framework.
